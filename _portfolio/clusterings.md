This project aims to delve into a wine cellar/store dataset that showcases high-quality wines from around the world. The dataset includes details about 7,500 harvested wines, covering regions, types, prices, ratings, and specific characteristics. The project aims to investigate, establish relationships, identify trends, and suggest improvements for a more efficient pricing strategy.

Analytical objectives centered around the primary goal of developing an effective pricing strategy, focusing on key factors like regions, types, price, and rating. Initial steps involved understanding the business, treating duplicates, missing values, and outliers, resulting in a refined dataset for exploratory analysis and predictive models.

Data adjustments included converting data types, eliminating duplicates, addressing price outliers, and treating missing values. The analysis focused on understanding the business by types and regions, identifying highest-priced and top-rated wines, and examining correlations between variables.

Predictive objectives aimed to predict wine ratings and prices based on variable combinations. Conclusions highlighted factors influencing ratings and prices, such as residual sugar level, alcohol content, and wine age.

Cluster analysis categorized wines based on prices, age, residual sugar, and alcohol percentage. Three clusters were identified, each representing distinct wine characteristics and market appeal.

Premium Pricing Strategy Enhancement was recommended for Cluster 1, emphasizing elevated prices for better ratings and brand prestige. For Cluster 2 wines, a value-focused pricing strategy was suggested, positioning them as affordable options with harmonious attributes. For Cluster 3 wines, a refinement strategy was proposed to enhance low-rated wines and cater to a specific niche audience.
