This project delved into a substantial dataset encompassing 212,404 books on Amazon from 1996 to 2014, comprising a staggering 142.8 million reviews.

Analytical visualizations, including histograms and word clouds (general, positive, and negative), were generated to offer insights into the reviews. The text reviews were classified into positive and negative sentiments based on their compound score.

A logistic regression model was employed to predict sentiment based on text-based reviews. Additionally, a multinomial logistic regression model predicted book ratings from text-based reviews.

The project aimed to extract valuable insights from this massive book reviews dataset, providing sentiment analysis and predictive models for both sentiment categories and book ratings.

As a result, the general word cloud was considerably similar to the positive word cloud, which shows that most of the reviews were positive. The compound score function used also indicates this. In the end, the logistic regression model built showed a 93% accuracy, and the multinomial logistic regression model had a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 1.33 and a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.58.
